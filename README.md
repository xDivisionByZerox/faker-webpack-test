# @faker-js/faker x webpack test repository

This repository is an example of how to integrate @faker-js/faker >= 7 with webpack < 5.

# prerequisite

You should cloning the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xDivisionByZerox/faker-webpack-test.git
```

Move into the project directory:

```bash
cd faker-webpack-test
```

And installing the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

# build

If you just want to build the source files you can run the build script.

```bash
npm run build
```

# serve

If you want to see that the generated source files really work you can serve them via the webpack dev server. 
This also includes the build step.

```
npm run serve
```
